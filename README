To compile:

from root directory, 

$ cmake .
$ make
$ ./pa3

I used CMake to compile my program. I used the starter code and
added shader options #1 (phong), #2 (blinn-phong), #3 (texture-
modulated blinn-phong), #4 (black + white checkerboard), and 
attempted #6 (normal map) using a tutorial I found online for 
bump mapping but did not end up getting it working. I also made 
a blinn-phong checkerboard shader and a blinn-phong shader that
makes a lollipop swirl pattern, as well as a shader that simply
maps an image onto the surface. I used the SOIL library to load
image files as textures, and included a couple images of a stone
texture that came from one of the tutorials I used. 

Keyboard controls:
0: silhouette shader
1: gourand phong shader
2: blinn-phong
3: texture-modulated blinn-phong
4: b/w checkerboard
5: blinn-phong checkerboard
6: failed attempt at normal mapping
7: swirl pattern
8: image texture map
9: toon example shader

These are some resources/tutorials I found online that were 
helpful and influenced my code:
